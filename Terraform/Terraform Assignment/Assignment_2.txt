Create a new Terraform file called main.tf.
Create three variables.
The first variable, called image_name, needs to be set to ghost:latest.
The second variable is called container_name with a default of ghost_blog.
The final variable is called ext_port and set the default to port 80.

Create a Docker image resource called ghost_image that uses the image_name variable.

Create a Docker container resource called ghost_container.
The name will use the container_name variable.
The image will use the ghost_image resource.
The internal port will be set to 2368.
The external port will use ext_port variable.

Initialize Terraform.

Create a Terraform plan that uses the following variables:

container_name = ghost_blog1
image_name = ghost:alpine
ext_port = 8080
Output the plan to a file called tfplan.

Then apply the plan using tfplan and make sure that the apply doesn’t prompt for input.

Step 1 : main.tf

terraform {
        required_providers {
                docker = {
                        source = "kreuzwerker/docker"
                        version = "2.12.0"
                }
        }
}

provider "docker" {
        host = "npipe:////.//pipe//docker_engine"
}

variable "image_name" {
        default = "ghost:latest"
}

variable "container_name" {
        default = "ghost_blog"
}

variable "ext_port" {
        default = "80"
}

resource "docker_image" "ghost_image" {
        name = "${var.image_name}"
}

resource "docker_container" "ghost_container" {
        name  = "${var.container_name}"
        image = "${docker_image.ghost_image.latest}"
        ports {
                internal = "2368"
                external = "${var.ext_port}"
        }
}

Step 2 : Initialize Terraform.

terraform init
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

Step 3 : 
terraform plan -var 'container_name=ghost_blog1' -out tfplan
terraform plan -var 'image_name=ghostLalpine' -out tfplan
terraform plan -var 'ext_port=8080' -out tfplan

Step 4 :
terraform plan -out tfplan

Step 5 : 
terraform apply "tfplan"
